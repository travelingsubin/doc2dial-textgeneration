# Text generation experiments for Dialdoc21 Shared Task
> Comparing SacreBLEU scores of generated text from pre-trained transformers using dialogue history and document context

This work is about my response generation experiments for Dialdoc21 Shared Task. I generate text using dialogue history and document context from the doc2dial dataset. Firstly, I use a GPT2 text generation pipeline. Secondly, I conduct the same task with another transformer model, XLNet, to compare the results. I evaluate the generated text using SacreBLEU scores. Finally, I summarise my work and suggest fine-tuning as a future work that could further improve the performance of pre-trained transformer models.
